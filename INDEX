contrastTest            'contrastTest' performs simultaneous tests of
                        linear contrasts on the parameters estimates
                        from a linear model.
estrogen                Microarray Data from an Experiment on Breast
                        Cancer Cells
findFClog               A function to find the fold change between two
                        experimental conditions in a factorial
                        experiment based on the linear model parameter
                        estimates for the data that has been
                        log-transformed.
findFC                  A function to find the fold change between two
                        experimental conditions in a factorial
                        experiment based on the linear model parameter
                        estimates.
kRepsOverA              A filter function for at least k sets of
                        replicates in a factorial experiment to have
                        mean larger than A.
madOutPair              A function to determine if the pair with the
                        largest difference between replicates is the
                        result of a single outlier.
outlierPair             A method for detecting single outliers in
                        experimental designs with only two replicates
                        per treatment condition.
par2lambda              A function to construct the appropriate lambda
                        matrix for a test of contrast of linear model
                        parameters.
